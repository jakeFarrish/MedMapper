# MedMapper

The purpose of this application is to assist a user with medication administration. This application recieves input from the user about their medications and when
it should be administered. The application sends alerts and reminders to the user to take their medications at the appropriate time, and logs successful administration 
for the user as well as other parties that the user may choose to share their information with. This will allow a user to track their medication usage, and help ensure  
that they are taking each medication at the appropriate time each day.
